Defination-->
	-Abstraction is a designed process which helps a Service Specifier to Specify the most 
	essential feature of the project without providing their implimentation details.
**Methods are Classified into two types-->
1)Concrete Methods.
2)Abstract Methods.

1)Concrete Methods-->
	Method with implimentation details i.e. Method with its body.
2)Abstact Method-->
	Method without any implimentation details(body) and prefix with the abstract keyword/
	Access Modifier and ending with the semicolon its known as Abstract Method.
	Syntax-->
	Access-Modifier abstract return-type Method-Name(Formal-parameters);
	example-->
	public abstract void addition(int a,int b);
**Que-->How to achieve Abstraction?
Answer-->1)By using Abstract class 
	 2)by Using Interface

**Classes are classified into two types-->
1)Abstract class
2)Concrete class

1)Abstract class-->
	if a class contains a one abstract methods either declared or inherited,then it is 
	mandatory to make a class abstract else we get a compile time error.
--A class which is prefix with abstract keyword or access-modifier this classs called as abstract 
  class.

2)Concrete class-->the class which is not prefix with abstract class is known as Concrete class.

**Note--->
-we cannot instanciation (create object) of an abstract class but we can have the Constructor 
in a abstract class.
